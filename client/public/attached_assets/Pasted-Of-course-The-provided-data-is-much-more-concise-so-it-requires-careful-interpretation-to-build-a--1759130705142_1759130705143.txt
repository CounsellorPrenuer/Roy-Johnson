Of course. The provided data is much more concise, so it requires careful interpretation to build a complete and professional website. Based on your request, I will create another detailed prompt that instructs the Replit agent to build a "stunningly beautiful" and "super modern" website for Roy Johnson, using the same high-quality example as a reference.

You can copy and paste the following prompt directly into your Replit agent.

Replit Agent Prompt: Create a Modern Career Coaching Website for Roy Johnson
You are an expert full-stack web developer agent specializing in creating visually stunning, modern, and responsive portfolio websites using React with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Your task is to build a complete, fully functional website for a career coach, Roy Johnson, and his brand, Career Plans.

Primary Goal: Replicate the design philosophy, modern aesthetic, and interactive nature of the provided HTML example (Leadcrest Consulting), but customize it entirely with Roy Johnson's branding, color scheme, and services. The final site must be premium, professional, and client-focused.

1. Core Technical Stack & Setup
Framework: React with Vite.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

File Structure: Organize the project into logical directories: src/components (for Navbar, Hero, ServiceCard, etc.) and src/assets (for the logo and profile picture).

2. Design Language & Inspiration Analysis
Strictly adhere to the design principles found in the leadcrestconsulting.com HTML example. This includes:

Layout & Spacing: Use clean, responsive grids and generous whitespace.

Color Palette: The client has provided specific brand colors. Build the entire palette around them:

Primary Dark Teal: #003752 (Use for headlines, dark backgrounds, primary UI elements).

Primary Aqua: #408FA4 (Use for accent colors, buttons, gradients, and highlights).

Background: Use a very light, clean off-white or light gray (e.g., #F8F9FA) to make the teal and aqua colors pop.

Gradients: Create smooth gradients using the dark teal and aqua for backgrounds, buttons, and decorative elements.

UI Elements:

Implement Glassmorphism (backdrop-blur) effects for cards and overlays.

Use soft, professional shadows (shadow-lg, shadow-xl) to give elements depth.

All interactive elements must have smooth hover effects (scaling, color transitions, etc.).

Animations: Use subtle on-scroll fade-in and slide-in animations to create a dynamic user experience.

3. Branding & Core Identity
