Create a secure, full-stack admin dashboard for my website, accessible at the /admin route. This dashboard will be used to monitor business metrics, view customer payments, and manage contact form submissions.

Core Functional Requirements:
1. Secure Authentication:

Create a login page at /admin/login.

Access to any page under /admin must be restricted to authenticated admin users only. Unauthorized users should be redirected to the login page.

Implement a secure method for storing admin credentials (e.g., hashed passwords).

2. Main Dashboard / Overview Page (/admin):
This will be the homepage after a successful login. It should display a summary of key metrics in clear, easy-to-read "stat cards."

Stat Cards to display:

Total Revenue: The sum of all "completed" payments.

Pending Payments: A count of all payments with a "pending" status.

Completed Payments: A count of all payments with a "completed" status.

Total Payments: A count of all payment records (regardless of status).

New Contact Requests: A count of all contact requests with a "new" or "unread" status.

Total Contact Requests: A count of all contact form submissions ever received.

3. Payment Management Page (/admin/payments):
A dedicated section to view and manage all payments.

Default View: Display a list of the most recent payments (e.g., the last 20).

"View All" Functionality: Include an option or a separate tab to view all payments with pagination (e.g., 20 payments per page).

Data Display: The payments should be displayed in a table with the following columns:

Payment ID

Customer Name

Customer Email

Plan Purchased (e.g., "Ascend", "Ascend Plus")

Amount

Status (e.g., "Completed", "Pending", "Failed")

Date of Payment

Features: The table should be searchable by Customer Name or Email.

4. Contact Request Management Page (/admin/contacts):
A dedicated section to view messages submitted through the website's contact form.

Functionality: Display a list of the most recent contact requests.

Data Display: The requests should be displayed in a table or list with the following information:

Sender's Name

Sender's Email

Message (a preview, with an option to view the full message)

Date Received

Status (e.g., "New", "Read")

Actions: Allow the admin to mark a message as "Read". New messages should be visually distinct (e.g., bolded).

Technical Specifications & Data Models:
To support these features, please define and use the following data models:

Payment Model:

id: Unique Identifier

customerName: String

customerEmail: String

planPurchased: String

amount: Number

status: String (Enum: 'completed', 'pending', 'failed')

createdAt: Timestamp

Contact Model:

id: Unique Identifier

name: String

email: String

message: Text

status: String (Enum: 'new', 'read')

submittedAt: Timestamp

AdminUser Model:

id: Unique Identifier

username: String

password: String (Hashed)

Backend:

Create secure REST API endpoints for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to Payments, Contacts, and Admin authentication.

The API should provide aggregated data for the overview dashboard (e.g., an endpoint /api/admin/stats).

Frontend:

The frontend should be a single-page application that communicates with the backend API.

The UI should be clean, responsive, and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Use a clear navigation structure (e.g., a sidebar) to switch between the Overview, Payments, and Contacts pages.
